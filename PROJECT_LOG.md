# Fleet Fuel Efficiency Project â€“ Summary Log

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Analyze and optimize fuel efficiency using telemetry data (e.g., GPS, fuel consumption, driver behavior).
- **Tools**: Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Git, GitHub.

---

## Key Milestones

### **April 17, 2025**
- Initialized the GitHub repository, set up folder structure, and configured environment.

### **April 18, 2025**
- Conducted initial exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualized fuel consumption, and cleaned data.

### **April 19, 2025**
- Explored feature engineering opportunities like time of day, average speed, idle time.

### **April 21, 2025**
- Linked GitHub repo to local project, pushed files, and began repository cleanup.

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Issue**: Difficulty with syncing data between local Git and GitHub.
- **Solution**: Resolved by checking remote repository configurations and adjusting file paths.

---

## Next Steps

- **Feature Engineering**: Add advanced features like trip distance and weather data.
- **Modeling**: Experiment with regression models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
- **Optimization**: Begin exploring possible optimizations like route planning and driver behavior adjustments.

## Summary of Key Learnings
- **Handling Missing Data**: Dealt with missing values using mean imputation.
- **EDA Best Practices**: Gained confidence with `matplotlib`/`seaborn` for visualizing trends and outliers.
- **GitHub Workflow**: Learned best practices for syncing repositories and handling file structure.
