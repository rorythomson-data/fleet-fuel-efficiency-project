# üóíÔ∏è Project Log ‚Äì Fleet Fuel Efficiency Project

## 1. **Project Overview**

- **Objective**: The goal of this project is to analyze and improve the fuel efficiency of a fleet of vehicles using telemetry data. Specifically, the analysis will focus on GPS data, fuel consumption, and driver behavior to uncover patterns that can lead to better route planning, fuel savings, and vehicle maintenance.
  
- **Tools and Technologies Used**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Git, GitHub

## 2. **Setup and Initialization**

- **Date**: April 17, 2025  
- **Action**: Ran `git init` to initialize a new Git repository. Set up the folder structure with `data/`, `notebooks/`, `output/`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and `PROJECT_LOG.md`.  
- **Problem**: Encountered issues with PowerShell blocking script execution when trying to activate the virtual environment.  
- **Solution**: Switched to **Command Prompt** and successfully activated the virtual environment with `venv\Scripts\activate`.

## 3. **Milestones**

### **Date**: April 18, 2025  
**Goal**: Complete initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the fleet fuel efficiency dataset.  
**Progress**:  
- Loaded the dataset into a Jupyter notebook (`eda_fuel_efficiency.ipynb`).
- Ran `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()` methods on the dataset.
- Visualized fuel consumption using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Cleaned missing values from key columns (e.g., fuel consumption, vehicle IDs).
- Observed no major issues during this step; the dataset seems well-structured.

**Problems faced and solutions**:  
- Encountered some missing values in the fuel consumption data, but handled them by replacing with the mean value.
- Decided to split the dataset into two parts (one for training and one for validation) based on available time series data.

## 4. **Technical Decisions**

### **Date**: April 19, 2025  
**Decision**: Choose between different types of feature engineering (time of day, average speed, idle time).  
**Why**: After doing some initial EDA, I realized that creating features related to the time of day, average speed, and idle time could give insight into the driving habits of different drivers, which might help predict fuel consumption better.

## 5. **Reflection and Lessons Learned**

### **Date**: April 19, 2025  
**Lessons Learned**:  
- **Handling missing data**: I learned that while mean imputation is simple and effective, it's worth considering other imputation methods in the future (e.g., using machine learning for imputation).
- **Visualization for EDA**: I feel more comfortable using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizing trends and outliers. It‚Äôs a powerful way to spot issues quickly.

**What I would do differently**:  
- I will spend more time cleaning and preparing the data before diving into feature engineering to avoid confusion later in the project.

## 6. **Next Steps and Plan**

### **Date**: April 20, 2025  
**Next Steps**:  
- Continue with feature engineering: adding more advanced features (e.g., distance between locations, traffic patterns).
- Explore unsupervised learning methods for clustering vehicles based on behavior.
- Prepare for the upcoming Datathon challenge by testing out a few potential models (e.g., regression, random forest).
  
**Short-term goals**:  
- Finish feature engineering and get the dataset ready for model training.  
- Experiment with a couple of basic machine learning models on the data.

**Long-term goals**:  
- Build a model that can accurately predict fuel consumption based on the data.
- Visualize model performance and interpretability for the Datathon.
